  Description: The northern and southern sections of Cardonis Valley are connected
    by a narrow passage through a small marsh. The fighting to gain control of this
    chokepoint has been intense. It seems that both sides have decided to send in
    heavy armour in an attempt to end the stalemate.
  SceneID: Bottleneck
