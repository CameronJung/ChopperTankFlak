  Description: It appears that elements of the enemy's 3rd mechanized cavalry division
    have snuck through the lines and are trying to capture one of our bases. To make
    matters worse, the enemy unit is mostly composed of attack helicopters. Meanwhile,
    the units we could muster are mostly tanks. However, the terrain not only favours
    our forces, but would also makes an excellent place for an ambush.
  SceneID: Flyswatter
