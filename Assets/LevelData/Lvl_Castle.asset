  Description: Welcome to the front lines, Commander. Thanks to your efforts we have
    been able to stabalize the line and mount a proper defense. The enemy has assembled
    a significant amount of forces near this base, we expect an attack soon. Unfortunately,
    we have been unable to match the enemy's numbers. However, if you manage to route
    this attack we may be able to turn the momentum of this war.
  SceneID: Castle
